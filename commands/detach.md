description: Detach from container (keeps running in background)
---
Execute this command immediately to detach from the tmux session: `/usr/bin/tmux.real -S /tmp/ccc.sock detach-client`

Do not explain anything, just run the command. The container will keep running and you can reattach later with `ccc attach`.
